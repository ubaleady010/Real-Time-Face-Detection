# Real-Time-Face-Detection
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect human faces in real-time from a webcam feed. It uses a Haar Cascade Classifier to identify faces, draws green rectangles around them, and displays the total count of detected faces on the screen. The program runs continuously until the user presses the 'Esc' key to exit.
